# Forest Fires with R and Pyton
## Overview
Forest fires can create ecological problems and endanger human lives and property. Understanding when they occur and what causes them is important for managing them. My goal is to conduct an explanatory analyses on the data to better understand it.

Here are descriptions of the variables in the data set and the range of values for each taken from the paper:

- X: X-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
- Y: Y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
- month: Month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
- day: Day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
- FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
- DMC: Duff Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
- DC: Drought Code index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
- ISI: Initial Spread Index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
- temp: Temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
- RH: Relative humidity in percentage: 15.0 to 100
- wind: Wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
- rain: Outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
- area: The burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84

The X and Y variables are coordinates of fire locations. The acronym FWI stands for "fire weather index", a method used by scientists to quantify risk factors for forest fires.

## Analysis

Using data visualization techniques to obtain the following:
- Number of Forest Fires per Month
- Number of Forest Fires per Day
- Monthly Boxplots
- Scatter Plots
