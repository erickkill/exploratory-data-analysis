# Used Car Listings on eBay

## Independent Project

We will be working on a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points that was prepared by Dataquest including simulating a less-cleaned version of the data.
